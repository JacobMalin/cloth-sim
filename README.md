# CSCI 5611 [Project 2](https://github.umn.edu/malin146/Project2)

By: Jacob Malin

This project uses cloth animaiton to recreate a short (4-5 second) serene shot from the Studio Ghibli film, Spirited Away. The scene depicts a small island in the ocean with a billowing clothesline. Below are a close up of the clothesline, my version of the scene, as well as the reference video that I have been working off of.
